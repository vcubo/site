At no charge, we process projects' schedules, risk registers, and changelogs. <br>
After a standardization and anonymization process, we integrate the data into our database. A greater universe of projects contributes to better understanding the drivers of your projects performance.   

##### The data of your company and your projects remains anonymous and safe.<br><br>
**First step**: Wrangling projects' data. All Companies have their toolsets, templates, and project controls procedures.
We process the documents and files containing the information that our models need:
1. Baselines, updates and final schedules for each project.
2. Risk registers.
3. Changelogs, and more.

**Second step**: We anonymize the sensitive information of your projects and company to protect your privacy.<br><br>
**Third step**: We integrate all the anonymized data of projects into our database.
